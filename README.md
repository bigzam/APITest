This project is built using VS 2013 and .NET Framework 4.5.1

For simplicity I used direct links to assemblies and not Nuget packages

Known issues:
It looks like documentation on Response fields here https://api.data.gov/docs/nrel/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/
 is outdated.
For example there is EV_connector_types return by nearest API request but it is not documented.
